Aviatrix is a crash mechanics-based game. The player places a bet by launching an airplane and must land the plane before it explodes. 
The longer the plane flies, the higher the winning coefficient. If the player fails to land the plane in time and it explodes, 
they lose their bet. If the player successfully lands the plane, the winnings are calculated as the bet multiplied by the coefficient 
at the moment of landing. Based on the provided data, the following tasks need to be completed:

1 Filter and describe errors in the data.
2 Prepare a brief report with metrics that you believe are most useful for description.
3 Attempt to evaluate user engagement: devise metrics and justify their use.
4 What additional fields/events would you request to implement for more thorough research?
